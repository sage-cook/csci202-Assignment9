		<h1>Final Project Check-in:</h1>
		<h2>What I Completed This Week:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Added two new tools which create 'tunnels,' connections to the outer wall of the circuit that will eventually be used as input/output locations.</li>
			<li>Added the simulate button! This is a testing feature and will later be replaced with a proper UI, but for now it runs one step of simulation on your circuit when pressed.</li>
			<li>Fixed the resolution of the canvases to look crisp on all displays.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What I Have Yet to Complete (In Order of Importance):</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Ability to save/load circuit layouts</li>
			<li>Menu for saved circuits</li>
			<li>Named tunnels (and maybe colors/shapes to tell them apart)</li>
			<li>Simulation controls which allow you to set simulation speed, start/pause/stop, and designate inputs from tunnels</li>
			<li>Adjustable size of circuit grid</li>
			<li><span>Nested Circuits: this is a major undertaking and will be split up into pieces.</span>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						Controls to specify whether circuit should be baked or nested.
					</li>
					<li>
						Baked Circuits: these work by first simulating the circuit with every possible set of simultaneous inputs and generating a truth table based on the outputs. This then produces a tile you can place in other circuits whose behavior is determined by that truth table. This type of circuit is best used for components that process signals, like logic gates, since it's less resource intensive and processes all inputs in a single step.
					</li>
					<li>
						Real Nested Circuits: these work by simulating their circuit alongside the containing circuit, and simply routing all incoming ants to the appropriate tunnels and all outgoing ants to the appropriate sides of the tile. These will probably be harder to implement despite being easier to understand, so I'm putting them second. This type of circuit is best used for components which need to remember their state or deal with timing, since these are things that baked circuits can't do.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some pre-built starter circuits. This game would be very frustrating if you were just tossed in with nothing but paths and ants, so the player should start with some basic components to play around with. They should not be able to see the inner workings though, as they will eventually be encouraged to design their own versions of these components.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<span id="feature-limit">This is where I think I will be able to get to by the due date. Anything after this is just extra.</span>
			<li>Ability to save/load game progress (Autosave?)</li>
			<li>Circuit tests: see if your circuit produces a desired output</li>
			<li>Currency System: buy materials/components and sell circuits for profit</li>
			<li>Tutorial</li>
			<li>Achievements?</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>The Game Thus Far:</h2>
		<p>Instructions: Draw paths by left-clicking and dragging with the draw tool. The ant tool places / rotates ants with left click. The tunnel tools place tunnels on the edge of the board with left-click. Right-click or shift-click with any tool erases instead. Click the "Simulate!" button to run one step of simulation.</p>
